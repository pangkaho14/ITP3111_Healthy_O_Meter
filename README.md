Branches:
- main
- sprint1
- sprint1_us-id

Workflow:
1. Work on sprintX branch.
2. Branch off of sprintX branch when working on a User Story.
3. If more than one person is working on the same User Story, then share the branch.
4. When a User Story is completed, do a Pull Request and request a reviewer (anyone except the PR requester will do, just need to get another pair of eyes).
5. Never commit broken code! Or else I will pull your ear >:(

Good git commit messages practice:
- feat: add new abilities
- fix: bug fix
- code: style/comment, no product impact
- chore: ci/cd, project structure changes
- refactor: code structure refactor
- revert: revert to previous code
- build: release #X

Branches:
- main
- sprint1
- sprint1_us-id

File and code naming conventions and standards:
- Use Pascal Case (e.g., don't use: Outofmemoryexception. use: OutOfMemoryException)
- Use descriptive names and don't abbreviate (e.g., don't use: lBtnStM. use: LargeButtonSettingsMenu)
