Good git commit messages practice:
- feat: add new abilities
- fix: bug fix
- code: style/comment, no product impact
- chore: ci/cd, project structure changes
- refactor: code structure refactor
- revert: revert to previous code
- build: release #X

Branches:
- main
- sprint1
- sprint1_us-id

File and code naming conventions and standards:
- Use Pascal Case (e.g., don't use: Outofmemoryexception. Use: OutOfMemoryException)
